NEXT BUG NUMBER: 5

Bug 4
-----
Sendall() isn't a good way of sending data. What happens if the
connection to the client is temporarily blocked (ie not actually
closed, but causes send() to block for a period of time). A solution
would be to use the MSG_NOWAIT flag. This tells the kernel to send
what it can and makes send() return the number of bytes sent. It would
cause some additional complexity in the handlers, but that's easily
dealt with.

Bug 3
-----
Server sometimes crashes. It's hard to duplicate conditions and I
haven't figured out what's causing it.

Bug 2
-----
Error pages are each sent by a different function. All error pages look
alike, so a single function should be all that's necessary.

Bug 1
-----
Browser only supports abs_path URI requests and not absoluteURI. See
RFC2616 5.1.2 Request-URI.
