BUGS
====

Server sometimes crashes. It's hard to duplicate conditions and I
haven't figured out what's causing it.

Error pages are each sent by a different function. All error pages look
alike, so a single function should be all that's necessary.

Browser only supports abs_path URI requests and not absoluteURI. See
RFC2616 5.1.2 Request-URI.
