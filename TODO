BUGS
====

Warning reporting system is crap. Remake it.

Error pages are each sent by a different function. All error pages look
alike, so a single function should be all that's necessary.

Browser only supports abs_path URI requests and not absoluteURI. See
RFC2616 5.1.2 Request-URI.

Requesting the root of any directory but the root returns a Page Not
Found error. It should return the index.xml file.
