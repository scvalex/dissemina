NEXT BUG NUMBER: 8

Bug 7
-----
Dissemina still determines the content type of a file by its
extension. This is a) not flexible b) usually wrong.
Is there any way to interface with the file command?

Bug 6
-----
Parsing of headers is not yet implemented, and what's implemented
looks like crap.
Maybe use YACC.

Bug 5
-----
Dcheck is not flexible enough. If you try to send malformed requsts,
dcheck catches them and, then, either corrects them or fails. It
should simply pass them to the server.
Try replacing urllib with something more lowlevel.

Bug 3
-----
Server sometimes crashes. It's hard to duplicate conditions and I
haven't figured out what's causing it.

Bug 2
-----
Error pages are each sent by a different function. All error pages look
alike, so a single function should be all that's necessary.

Bug 1
-----
Browser only supports abs_path URI requests and not absoluteURI. See
RFC2616 5.1.2 Request-URI.
