BUGS
====

Error pages are each sent by a different function. All error pages look
alike, so a single function should be all that's necessary.

Browser only supports abs_path URI requests and not absoluteURI. See
RFC2616 5.1.2 Request-URI.

Requesting the root of any directory but the root returns a Page Not
Found error. It should return the index.xml file.
  
Siege reports that avalability was 100% during the siege even though
accept() was spewing out Too Many Open Files errors. This is, most likely,
an error. Probably something to do with the way 404 errors are sent.

Accept() has problems with many files. See above. Use this to your
advantage.

No security is present. The browser could easily request any file
that the server has access to. I should implement some better path
manipulation routines.

Is it possible for a file be openable for reading ("r"), but not for
binary reading ("rb")? If so, I have a problem.
