Dissemina
=========
  a fast webserver

The scenario invisioned is this:
  - Alice has a directory of files she wishes to share with Bob, Carman, and Dan
  - but the three are not interested in all the files or even the same files
  - Bob suggests Alice start a server and make these files public
  - Alice has no previous experience with webservers, so she wants a
  webserver that she can use without having to go through pages and
  pages of documentation

This is where Dissemina comes into the picture. Dissemina is drop-in
webserver written with simplicity and speed in mind. The goal is to make
a webserver that can be deployed immediatly with NO configuration.

In this case, Alice can just get the sever's executable, put it into
the directory she wants to make public and run it. Dissemina immediatly
starts serving the files. Now all that's left is for Alice to tell Bob
and the others her IP address.

Feature plan for 0.1:
  * serve static files from the current directory with minimmum hustle [done]
  * guess filetype and fill in the Content-Type header correctly [partial]
  * handle thousands of requests per second well [no]
  * runs on Linux [done]
  * runs on Windows [no]
